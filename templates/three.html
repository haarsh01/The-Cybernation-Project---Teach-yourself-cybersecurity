<h1> #3 Sensitive Data Exposure </h1>
<div class="jumbotron white">
    <p> Sensitive data exposures when an organization accidentally exposes personal data of its users. Also known as data breach, these are one of the most wide-spread vulnerabilities. This attack encompasses the stealing of personal identifiable information or PIL data that should ideally be highly protected.
This sensitive data that is exposed when this vulnerability is exploited includes passwords, credit card numbers, credentials, classified health information etc. Over the last few years, sensitive data exposure has been one of the most common attacks around the world. Some examples of data leaks that resulted in sensitive data exposure include the Brazilian C&A, a fashion retail clothing chain suffered a gift card platform cyberattack in August 2018, the Uber breach in 2016 that exposed the personal information of 57 million Uber users, as well as 600,000 drivers, and the Target store data breach that occurred around Thanksgiving exposing credit/debit card and contact information of up to 110 million people.
</p>

<div class="jumbotron lightblue">
  <p>Although failure to encrypt sensitive data is the main reason why these attacks are so widespread, even encrypted data can be broken down due to weaknesses in the key generation process, key management process, algorithm usage, protocol, usage, and cypher usage. Due to the huge number of weaknesses that may lead to this attack, this vulnerability is very hard to explore. The consequences, however, of such a breach are grave and can cause immense monitory losses to both the users as well as the target organization.
One of the main ways in which this data is leaked is in transit. According to the official OWASP document,  one of the best ways to protect data in transit is to have an SSL certificate for the concerned web application. SSL is the old name for the TLS protocol which facilitates the establishment of an encrypted link between the web server and the browser. OWASP also provide a comprehensive DIY guide to establish and install an SSL certificate here. This vulnerability may also be prevented from being exploited by using HTTPS security on web applications.

  <p>Some suggestions that can adopted to prevent sensitive data exposure are listed below:

      Classifying the data that is processed, stored, or transmitted by a web application. Classification helps in identifying which data is sensitive according to privacy laws, regulatory requirements, or business needs. After performing this identification, controls can suitably be applied to highly sensitive data.
      Prevent the storage of sensitive data unnecessarily. This type of data should be discarded as soon as possible. PCI DSS compliant tokenization or truncation can be used to achieve this as data that is not retained cannot be stolen.
      All sensitive data should always be encrypted. Up-to-date and strong, standard algorithms, protocols, and keys should be put in place and proper key management should be ensured.
