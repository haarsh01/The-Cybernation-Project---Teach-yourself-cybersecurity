# Django-Cybernation
The cybernation project is a web application developed as a part of my internship with the Ministry of Electronics and Information technology. The application is developed purely using Django and Front-End technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootsrap and so forth. The sole purpose of the project is to spread awareness about the most prevalent web application attack vectors in the Indian Cyber space. A hackable interface has also been iuncluded to help the visitor experience how real life hacks actually take place. Safe Browsing and internet usage tips are also provided.
